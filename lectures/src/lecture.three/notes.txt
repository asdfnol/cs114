a linked list uses NODES
a NODE has two portions.
    - the data portion
        - the data portion refers to the data, not an actual container
    - a pointer to the NEXT portion
so on and so forth

the LAST node contains a null pointer.

an outer class has access to an inner classes data. and vice versa.
