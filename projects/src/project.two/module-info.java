        so this whole project is just making a data structure that works
        exactly like the array based data structure, but with recursion. which 
        we've done with stacks and queues. it just has to be sorted. so, 
        really we just gotta think about how we're doing the conditionals.

        i'm going to work on it in the lecture.five package.
        and then bring everything over to here when i have to submit it all 
        nicely.
        i'll ask him how he wants it submitted.
